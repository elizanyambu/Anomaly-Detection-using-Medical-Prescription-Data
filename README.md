# Anomaly Detection using Medical Prescription Data

According to estimations from the FBI (2019) and the U.S Department of Health report, 
more than $1.2 billion in loss is due to healthcare fraud schemes and the amount is expected to increase each year. 
The Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) note that fraudulent providers and organized criminal schemes cause 
the main financial losses. The healthcare system in the U.S. is especially vulnerable to fraud and abuse as doctors and 
medical facilities do not bill patients for services directly, but instead are paid directly by insurance companies and 
the government. CMS reported for 2019, that $1.7 billion claims were submitted by 130 providers resulting in more than 
$900 million in lost payments. Considering the enormous amounts of money that flow in the financial system, numerous 
service providers are enticed to commit fraud. Prescription fraud detection is challenging 
due to two major reasons: valid and fraudulent behaviors change depending on the circumstances and most healthcare fraud 
datasets are highly skewed. Given these challenges, the demand for new fraud detection 
solutions is increasing. A possible solution to reduce the amount of fraud, waste and abuse within the healthcare industry 
is the design of a machine learning-based fraud detection system.
